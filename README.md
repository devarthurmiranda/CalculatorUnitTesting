  <h2> About </h2>
  <p> The idea of this guide is to introduce unit testing with the help of JUnit.  </p>
  <br>

  <h2>Form of Approach</h2>
  <p> A calculator model was used with methods that aim to perform the four basic operations. The creation of the tests can come before or after the implementation of the model, so each method will be tested in a 'unit' way, expecting previously defined results to verify the reliability of the algorithm. </p>
